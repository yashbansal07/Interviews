Puzzle -
There are 3 jars, namely, A, B, C. All of them are mislabeled. Following are the labels of each of the jars: 

A: Candies - N -> a+b ||  10 -> 7+3
B: Sweets - M    11 -> 3+8
C: Candies and Sweets (mixed in a random proportion) - O

You can put your hand in a jar and pick only one eatable at a time. Tell the minimum number of eatable(s) that has/have to be picked in order to label the jars correctly. 

My Ans:- Max(N,M)
         But it is wrong, chitra Menon told me it is having an numeric value as an answer.


=============================================================


Given an integer K and an array arr[] of N integers which contains the ids of the opened apps in a system where 

arr[0] is the app currently in use
arr[1] is the app which was most recently used and
arr[N â€“ 1] is the app which was least recently used.
The task is to print the contents of the array when the user using the system presses Alt + Tab exactly K number of times.

Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 2, 4, 1}, K = 3 
Output: 4 3 5 2 1 

Solution:-

void reArrangeTabs(int a[], int k){
	if(k >= a.size())
		k = k % a.size();

	int newRecentTab = a[k];  // 4
	for(int i = k; i > 0; ){
		a[i] = a[i-1];
		i--;
	}
	a[0] = newRecentTab;
}

At i = 3 
a[3] = a[3-1] = 2;   3, 5, 2, 2, 1

At i = 2
a[2] = a[2-1] = 5;   3, 5, 5, 2, 1

At i = 1			       3, 3, 5, 2, 1

i = 0                Loop will exit.
